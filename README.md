# Derivatives_Portfolio_Analyzer
This financial application is built to solve the problem of a small individual investor who focuses their portfolio on derivatives trading, who can't easily parse and analyzie their options trading strategies within their portfolios. This application and analysis is meant to provide an easier way for our investor to analyze their portfolio, with a focus on comparing different options strategies employed over time. It is built to automate the data exploration process for the end-user, but allowing them to import a csv file of raw data from their trading platform, and load it into a CLI application that automatically recognizes and sorts the data into the different strategies used by the investor. The investor can then query the tool to analyze any stock ticker or strategy they used, to visualize the successes and failures of their trades. This also provides a metrics dashboard that originates in a Jupiter notebook, but is deployed as a web link through the Voila tool. This allows the investor to easily deploy and visualize the analysis of their portfolio as a whole.
